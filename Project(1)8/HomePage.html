        <h3>What is My Mission?</h3>
        <h4><I>Hello my name is Rayyan Hasan Goraya. I want to make the world a better place. I really want to end Gender Inequality seriously because, according to the Canadian Women's Foundation, it will take 267.6 years to close the gender pay gap. Do you want your kids to live in a world where they are paid based on their gender? In 2022 full-time and part-time women in Canada were paid 89 cents for every dollar a man made. According to McKinsey and Company, “Women leaders are overworked and underrecognized”(“McKinsey,” 2022). Help put an end to gender discrimination.
